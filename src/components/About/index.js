           Hello!!, My name is Isaac Harris and i am a Junior Web Developer.
           I was a Chef for about six years when i decided to make a change,
           I chose coding and web development because of my love of technology and
           making websites are pretty awesome. I have skiils in Node.js, React, Express.js
           HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, GraphQl and many more!
           Coding is my new passion and I am ready to turn it into my next career!
